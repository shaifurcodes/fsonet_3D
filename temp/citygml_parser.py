    Given a citygml file (.gml) this class
        1. parses the 3D building structure and save it
        2. visualize the 3D structures (not recommended for large swathes of area)
        3. calculate the line-of-sight assuming one FSO antenna at the roof-top of everybuilding
        4. calculate coverage assuming one base-station at the ground level of every building
        4. save the above graphs for future flow-level computation of FSONet
